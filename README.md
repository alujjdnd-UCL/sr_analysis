# Analysis of Reddit's Social Dimensions
This repository is the companion codebase to the report "Explorations of Redditâ€™s Social Dimensions Through Computational Linguistics Methods", a study done as a deliverable for my Undergraduate Research Internship at the UCL Department of Computer Science.

I (Jiuyu Zhang) am the sole and main maintainer of this repository and codebase - any queries relating to the code or the study should be directed to me on my ucl.ac.uk email address.

This study would not have been possible without the generous inputs of time and effort of Prof Licia Capra and Tim Douglas, both of whom have contributed greatly not just to this investigation, but to my personal growth and development. I owe my thanks to them.

This repository is published under the MIT license, and is considered open-source software.
