Another problem I've noticed is that almost anyone who moves here sees it as just a pit stop in life before moving on. Hell, even most of the people born here view it like that. Whether they do move on or not (mostly not), a lot of people just don't see it as \"home\". The people here just sit around and bitch and moan and never do anything about its problems because they're always looking to move to Austin or San Francisco or some other magical land where working at a Starbucks or in a cubicle develops some profound meaning unattainable in Houston. When the only people who see it as home are the industries, it's bound to feel soulless. The people here don't care about recycling because no one sees themselves as really having any stake in it since they're just visiting for 10, 20, 30, 40 years.","created_utc":"1217455430","author":"spacekraken","controversiality":0,"score_hidden":false,"ups":3,"archived":true,"link_id":"t3_6u4tg","retrieved_on":1425872105,"name":"t1_c04vl7u","author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qho4"}
